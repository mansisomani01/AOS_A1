# AOS_ASSIGNMENT1

# ASSIGNMENT1_1:- 
I have tested using relative path that is I have tested in same directory itself.
In this question we need to reverse the contents of the file and store the result in a new file
in the directory named “Assignment1_1”.

# Explanation of code:- 
Here , main function takes command line arguments. It assigns index-1 to input_file_name . If number of arguments is not 2 then it prints an error message.
After that, I created a direcotory named Assignment1_1 using mkdir function.
